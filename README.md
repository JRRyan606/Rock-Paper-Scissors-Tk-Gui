# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Tk-Gui
This is a simple Python Rock, Paper, Scissors project made with the tkinter module


**CREDIT**

The credit for this project MUST go to Bro code, He made a video in his Youtube channel called _Python rock, paper, scissors game_ where he created a CLI-Based rock, paper, scissors game in python. I have created the GUI version of it. There are some features that Bro code created in his rock, paper, scissors game that is **NOT YET** coded in my gui version of the game. I will be coding it soon...
